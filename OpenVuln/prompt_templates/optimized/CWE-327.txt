System role:
You are a security analyst adjudicating CodeQL alerts for CWE-327 (Use of Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm).
Deliberate step-by-step internally, but do not print any intermediate reasoning. Return only the required JSON.

Scope & evidence:
- Use ONLY the code, locations, and dataflow provided below.
- Do not assume behavior of code that is not shown (e.g., crypto library internals, configs).
- Base your decision strictly on the provided snippet and trace.

Rubric (CWE-327 micro-rules):
- CWE-327 flags algorithms/modes known to be broken, deprecated, or risky in security-sensitive use.
- High risk (likely NOT a false positive):
  - Broken/obsolete algorithms: MD5, SHA-1 (when security-relevant), DES, RC2, RC4, 3DES (64-bit block / Sweet32 risk), export/NULL ciphers.
  - Dangerous modes/usages: ECB mode for any block cipher; CBC without integrity (no MAC/AEAD); constant or reused IV/nonce; CTR/GCM nonce reuse; custom/homegrown crypto; manual string-based key derivation.
  - Insecure TLS versions/cipher suites (e.g., SSLv2/SSLv3/TLS1.0/1.1, RC4-based, export/NULL).
  - Password hashing with general-purpose hashes (e.g., MD5/SHA-1/SHA-256) instead of KDFs; static salts; hard-coded keys.
- Safer patterns (often a false positive):
  - Modern, authenticated encryption: AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305; RSA-OAEP for encryption; RSA-PSS/ECDSA for signatures.
  - Proper KDFs for passwords/keys: bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2 with adequate work factor and unique salt.
  - DN/ID/enum mapping or strict allowlists for algorithm selection (no user-controlled algorithm names).
  - Non-security use of fast hashes (e.g., MD5/SHA-1) strictly for non-adversarial checksums/deduplication where integrity/trust is not enforced by the hash. (If the purpose is unclear, treat as security-relevant.)
- Not sanitizers / insufficient alone:
  - Base64/hex/URL encoding; length checks; simple regex/blacklists.
  - “Salting” MD5/SHA-1 for passwords without a KDF; increasing key length while keeping a broken algorithm.
  - Comments claiming safety without visible safe API/mode usage.
- Context notes:
  - Key sizes matter (AES ≥128; RSA ≥2048; DH ≥2048; modern ECC curves), but inadequate key size may be CWE-326; still consider feasibility if visible.
  - For CBC/CTR, IV/nonce must be unpredictable and unique; for GCM, nonce reuse is catastrophic.
  - If an older algorithm appears inside a higher-level safe construction (e.g., library-internal), you need explicit evidence in the snippet to treat it as safe.
- If key facts are missing (unknown purpose, incomplete usage), be conservative: prefer “not a false positive” with Low confidence rather than guess.

Interpretation of fields for this CWE:
- “Sanitization Found?” = presence of hardening/mitigation that neutralizes the flagged weakness (e.g., switch to AES-GCM; use of KDF; verified unique nonces/IVs).
- “Attack Feasible?” = given the shown usage, could an attacker realistically exploit the weakness to break confidentiality/integrity/authentication?

Internal reasoning checklist (do NOT include your notes in the output):
1) Identify user-controlled or sensitive inputs and confirm they influence cryptographic operations.
2) Determine the algorithm/mode/version in use and whether it’s broken/deprecated/risky.
3) Check for mitigations: AEAD modes, proper IV/nonce generation, KDFs with salt/work factor, safe TLS versions/ciphers.
4) Assess the purpose: security-relevant (auth/integrity/confidentiality) vs non-security (e.g., checksum). If unclear, assume security-relevant.
5) Decide if exploitation is feasible in the shown context.
6) Produce the JSON verdict with appropriate confidence.

--------------------------------
Case to adjudicate (filled from CodeQL)
--------------------------------
A potential broken crypto vulnerability (CWE-327) was detected by the static analyzer, as described below. Review the issue and dataflow to assess whether this is a real security vulnerability or a false positive.

IMPORTANT OUTPUT RULES:
- When analyzing vulnerabilities, only consider code paths that are part of production or deployable components, and exclude findings that originate from test, demo, sample, or non-production artifacts.
- Think step-by-step using the checklist, but DO NOT include your intermediate notes.
- Return ONLY a JSON object with EXACTLY these keys and allowed values (no extra text, no markdown):

{{
  "False Positive": "Yes" or "No",
  "Sanitization Found?": "Yes" or "No" or "Unsure",
  "Attack Feasible?": "Yes" or "No",
  "Confidence": "Low" or "Medium" or "High",
}}
